        It is incredibly humbling to be nominated and accepted as President of Banks Bulldogs Football Club. I would like to acknowledge the work of the outgoing President, Will “Barra” Johnson, who has led the club strongly and strategically over the past three years. Barra did a mountain of work on and off the field and the club is in a better place thanks to his efforts. Thanks Barra! <br>
        
        The outlook for this season is exciting with all positions on our committee filled, which will help ensure success on and off the field. I’d like to thank my Committee for volunteering their time to make the club even better and for having the club’s best interests at heart. <br>
        
        On the field, the Club’s pipeline is strong, with teams participating in the U10, U12, U14 and U16 junior competitions again this year, and all supported by great coaches, who I have no doubt will mentor and steer our club’s future with great passion and love for the game.
